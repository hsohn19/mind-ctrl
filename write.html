   <p> <b>anonymous: </b> <br> </br>I wasn't able to get treatment for my anxiety until I finally moved out due to the stigma around it. Luckily, I was able to find a support system and have my anxiety checked out which made it more bearable to live with </p>
   <p> <b> anonymous: </b> <br> </br> My anxiety has gotten in the way of me doing simple tasks that others may find easy. With this I am trying to put myself out there and do things that would help me overcome it little by little.

   <p> <b> anonymous: </b> <br> </br> Sometimes when my head starts fill up unwanted thoughts and I  need a break from it. I alway revert to listening to music and reading to help calm myself and zone the world out for a bit.

   <p> <b> anonymous: </b> <br> </br> I struggled with my mental health for a few years and I constantly isolated myself. But with help of my close friends I started to talk about my feelings and open up.
