  <p> Post traumatic stress disorder is a disorder in which a person has difficulty recovering after experiencing or witnessing a terrifying event. People who have PTSD may feel stressed or frightened, even when they are not in danger. Symptoms usually begin early, within 3 months of the traumatic incident, but sometimes they begin years afterward. Anyone can develop PTSD at any age.</p>
