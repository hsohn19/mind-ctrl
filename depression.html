  <p> Clinical depression is a mental health disorder characterized by persistently depressed mood or loss of interest in activities, causing significant impairment in daily life. It causes severe symptoms that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working. Research suggests that genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors play a role in depression.</p>
